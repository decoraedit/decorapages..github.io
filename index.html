          The fashion system is broken: from human exploitation to environmental
          issues. As we are all part of it whether as consumer, maker or creator we
          all have a voice and power to reinvent the flow of the industry. <br><br>
          Fashion is certainly an intriguing industry as the meaning of apparel
          is no longer a strict necessity but over time has become a strong
          medium for self-expression and cultural belonging. However, there's
          much more to it. <br><br> <span>The Decora edit</span>  wants to be part of the fashion
          revolution raising awareness on the unsustainable practices of the
          industry and enchanting the innovations and contributions that are
          making fashion a better industry. <br><br> <span>The Decora edit</span> is a space for the
          real voices of fashion space that are actively making a difference
          within the industry, innovating practices and rethinking the system in
          a more sustainable way while bringing a real purpose to the system. <br><br>
          Whether is with the use of technology to bring transparency from the
          supply chain, smarter materials or better design thinking, <span>The Decora
          edit</span> wants to engage and open conversations on the breaking
          innovations that are moving the fashion industry towards an ethical
          ecosystem and possibly inspire more people to join the movement.<br><br>
          Follow the journey and get inspired, <br><br><span>The Decora edit</span>
